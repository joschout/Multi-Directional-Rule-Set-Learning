    From http://www.zaxrosenberg.com/unofficial-apyori-documentation/

    Each RelationRecord  reflects all rules associated with a specific itemset (items) that has relevant rules.
    Support (support), given that itâ€™s simply a count of appearances of those items together,
    is the same for any rules involving those items, and so only appears once per RelationRecord.
    The ordered_statistic  reflects a list of all rules that met our min_confidence  and min_lift  requirements
    (parameterized when we called apriori() ).
    Each OrderedStatistic  contains the antecedent (items_base)
    and consequent (items_add) for the rule, as well as the associated confidence  and lift .
